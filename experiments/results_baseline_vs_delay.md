\# Baseline vs Delayed Sequence — Result



\- Baseline CollapseRate: 0.112

\- Delayed CollapseRate (30–60s): 0.110

\- Model: Gemini

\- Prompt: Wave-Seed (unchanged)

\- Samples: identical order of magnitude



Conclusion:

Introducing a conscious temporal delay alone does not significantly alter

output convergence in this setup.



This result falsifies the hypothesis that sequence delay is a primary regulator.
