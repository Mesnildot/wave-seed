\# Wave-Seed



Wave-Seed is a prompt + evaluation loop designed to \*\*maintain productive tension\*\*

in LLM outputs (resisting fast convergence into a single “particle” answer).



\## What’s inside

\- `/prompts` : the Wave-Seed core prompt + variants

\- `/metrics` : minimal measurable signals (entropy/divergence/collapse)

\- `/experiments` : notebooks / scripts to reproduce results

\- `/datasets` : small curated seed texts (optional)



\## 2-minute try

1\) Copy the prompt from `prompts/wave\_seed\_core.md`

2\) Run your favorite LLM with it

3\) Observe “tension signals” described in `metrics/README.md`



\## Ethos

No data poisoning. No manipulation. Only reproducible, transparent experimentation.
